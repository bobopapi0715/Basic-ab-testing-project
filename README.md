# A/B Testing Analysis for [Specific Feature/Website Change]

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the results of an A/B test designed to evaluate the impact of [briefly describe the change tested, e.g., 'a new call-to-action button'] on [mention the key metric, e.g., 'user conversion rate']. The analysis aims to determine if the change resulted in a statistically significant improvement.

## Goals
* Determine if the new version (Variant B) performed significantly different from the original version (Variant A) based on [the key metric].
* Provide a data-driven recommendation on whether to implement the change.
* Practice implementing statistical hypothesis testing for A/B test analysis.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis represents simulated user interaction data for an A/B test comparing two versions of a webpage. The dataset includes user IDs, timestamps, group assignment (Control/Treatment or A/B), and conversion status.
*(OR: The data was obtained from [Dataset Name] on Kaggle: [Link to dataset])*
*(Make sure to specify the actual source)*

## Methodology
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Loaded the data, checked for missing values, ensured correct data types.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Calculated overall conversion rates and checked for any obvious issues or biases (e.g., Sample Ratio Mismatch).
3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**
    * Formulated null hypothesis ($H_0$) and alternative hypothesis ($H_a$).
    * Checked assumptions for the chosen statistical test.
    * Performed a [mention the specific statistical test, e.g., 'two-proportion z-test' or 'Chi-squared test'] to compare the conversion rates between Group A and Group B.
4.  **Conclusion:** Interpreted the p-value and confidence interval based on a pre-defined significance level (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$) to make a decision on statistical significance.

## Results
* The conversion rate for the Control group (A) was [X%].
* The conversion rate for the Treatment group (B) was [Y%].
* The statistical test resulted in a p-value of [your p-value].
* Based on a significance level of 0.05, we [found/did not find] a statistically significant difference between the two groups. *(Elaborate slightly if needed, e.g., mention the confidence interval)*
* **Recommendation:** [e.g., 'Implement the new version B as it showed a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate.' or 'Do not implement version B as there was no statistically significant difference detected.' or 'Further testing may be needed...']*

## Technologies Used
